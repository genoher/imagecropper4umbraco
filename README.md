====================
Image cropper for Umbraco fixing PNG and auto crops.

This package installs an extended version of the default image cropper data type.

This cropper supports transparent PNGs and allows single dimension constraints.
With single dimension constraints you can define crops that are fixed in width with flexible height or vice versa.
